# Advanced Enterprise Network Implementation

## Overview
This project presents the design and implementation of a multi-site enterprise network using modern Datacom concepts and technologies.  
The objective is to build a scalable, structured, and secure network architecture while applying key principles such as hierarchical design, dynamic routing, service segmentation, IPv4 addressing, monitoring, and troubleshooting.


---

## Project Objectives
- Build a multi-layer enterprise topology (Access, Distribution, Core).  
- Configure core Layer 2 and Layer 3 network services.  
- Deploy IPv4 addressing schemes.  
- Implement dynamic routing across sites.  
- Provide mechanisms for service separation and scalability.  
- Validate network connectivity and performance.  
- Simulate network faults and document troubleshooting steps.  

---

## Project Structure

### **Week 1 – Enterprise Network Foundation**
- Designed the hierarchical network topology.  
- Configured VLANs and Layer 2 switching.  
- Set up inter-VLAN communication.  
- Implemented an IPv4 addressing plan and basic routing.

**Deliverables**
- Topology diagram  
- VLAN design  
- Connectivity tests  

---

### **Week 2 – Routing & Dual-Stack Preparation**
- Configured multi-site routing.  
- Configured Firewalls and security .  
- Applied basic ACLs and security filtering.

**Deliverables**
- Routing configuration  
- IPv4 connectivity validation  
- ACL/security documentation  

---

### **Week 3 – Core Enhancements & Service Segmentation**
- Prepared the core/backbone for scalable service delivery.  
- Introduced service isolation mechanisms.  
- Added automated addressing features and additional security policies.

**Deliverables**
- Core/backbone configuration  
- Service-isolation testing  
- Addressing service configuration  

---

### **Week 4 – Fault Testing & Documentation**
- Simulated routing and connectivity faults.  
- Used diagnostic tools to identify and resolve issues.  
- Implemented network monitoring and logging.  
- Prepared the final technical documentation and presentation.

**Deliverables**
- Troubleshooting documentation  
- Monitoring/logging configuration  
- Final report  
- Final presentation
